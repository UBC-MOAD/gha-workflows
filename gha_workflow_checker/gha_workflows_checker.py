"""Use GitHub CLI tool to list GitHub Actions workflows in repositories with their
enabled/disabled status.

Initial impetus for this script was to provide an easy way to check for GitHub's automatic
disabling of scheduled sphinx-linkcheck workflows in repos that haven't had activity for >60d.

Run via gha_workflows_checker run/debug config in VS Code, or in a terminal via:

    $ conda activate gha-workflows
    (gha-workflows)$ python3 gha_workflow_checker/gha_workflow_checker.py
